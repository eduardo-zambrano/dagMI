Description: Implements the multilinear inequality test for directed acyclic
    graph (DAG) structures based on Carbery's inequality. Provides tools for
    testing DAG compatibility, distinguishing between Markov equivalent DAGs,
    and performing constrained bootstrap inference. The methodology is based
    on the density-corrected formulation of Carbery's multilinear generalization
    of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
