\title{Extract Subgraph}
\usage{
extract_subgraph(dag, nodes)
}
\arguments{
\item{dag}{A dag object}

\item{nodes}{Character vector of node names to include}
}
\value{
A dag object representing the subgraph
}
\description{
Extracts a subgraph containing specified nodes from a DAG.
}
\details{
The subgraph contains only the specified nodes and edges between them.
Nodes that were connected through intermediate nodes in the original
DAG will NOT have direct edges in the subgraph.
}
\examples{
# Create DAG: X1 -> X2 -> X3 -> X4
A <- matrix(c(0, 1, 0, 0,
              0, 0, 1, 0,
              0, 0, 0, 1,
              0, 0, 0, 0), 4, 4, byrow = TRUE)
g <- dag(A, nodes = c("X1", "X2", "X3", "X4"))

# Extract subgraph with X1, X2, X3
sub_g <- extract_subgraph(g, c("X1", "X2", "X3"))

}
